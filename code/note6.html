<center><font color="white">Wattpad books are a collection of pure imagination and talent.
The contents of books are also called books, as are other compositions of that length.
 For instance, Aristotle's Physics, the constituent sections of the Bible, and 
even the Egyptian Book of the Dead are called books independently of their physical form. 
Conversely, some long literary compositions are divided into books of varying sizes, 
which typically do not correspond to physically bound units.
