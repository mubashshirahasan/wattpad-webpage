DESCRIPTION:Freedom – that is what Lilly Linton wants most in life.
 Not marriage, not a brood of squalling brats, and certainly not love<br>, 
thank you very much! But freedom is a rare commodity in 19th-century London,
 where girls are expected to spend their lives sitting at home,
 fully occupied with looking pretty. <br>Lilly is at her wits’ end – until 
a chance encounter with a dark, dangerous and powerful stranger changes her
 life forever... Enter the world of Mr Rikkard Ambrose, where the only rule is: 
Knowledge is power is time is money!</b></font></center></body></html>
