DESCRIPTION:The name is Shay Ricca. I really hate high school. I'm not a nerd by the way. I'm only dressed like one for my safety. I wouldn't be acting so weak and timid just for any reason. These guys are lucky I'm laying low or else they'd be crying back to their mommas.

Do you know what I hate more?

When some guy comes and ruins my carefully planned disguise. Then, throw in some Family drama and people who are targeting my life. 

Goodbye Nerd Disguise, hello old identity, old life, old friends, and new enemies. It's the Family business, where plotting someone's assassination is just part of the daily duty.
